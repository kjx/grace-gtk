The grace-gtk distribution includes a number of demo programs using the
bindings:

- helloworld.grace displays a single window with a single button,
  terminating when the button is clicked. It uses gtk.window and
  gtk.button.

- greet.grace prompts the user for their name, and prints a greeting
  when a button is clicked or the enter key is pressed. It also uses
  gtk.entry and gtk.box (gtk.hbox in GTK+ 2).

- drawing.grace (GTK+ 3) and drawing2.grace (GTK+ 2) use
  gtk.drawing_area to make a paintable area, in which the user can paint
  simple three-coloured pictures. The drawing is performed using the
  cairo bindings. It also uses gtk.accel_group to make the program close
  when the escape key is pressed.

- simpleeditor.grace gives a simple code editor, with a gtk.text_view
  for code entry and a button to run the Grace code the user has
  written. A gtk.scrolled_window provides scrollbars for long code,
  while box.pack_start flags make the text widget resize to fit the
  window. Output and any errors are displayed in other windows. The
  program also demonstrates the use of text buffers and gtk.text_iter,
  and the creation of tags to colour or change how text is displayed.

- pngviewer.grace is a simple image viewer that can only display PNG
  images. The images are loaded using Cairo's built-in PNG
  functionality, cairo.image_surface_create_from_png, and scaled to fit
  the window. The window is scaled to fit on the screen using
  information from gdk.screen_get_default. Multiple images may be given
  on the command-line and cycled through with the spacebar and backspace
  keys.  This program includes code to support both GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3
  drawing areas.

- simplegraphics.grace is an implementation of a simple graphics API,
  which has also been implemented for the JavaScript backend. A simple
  example program simplegraphics_example.grace exercises its
  functionality, and runs equally on both platforms.
